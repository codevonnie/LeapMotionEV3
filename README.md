# Gesture Based UI Development Project

## Introduction
This project is for a Gesture Based UI Development module for 4th year Software Development at Galway Mayo Institute of Technology.  The aim of this project was to develop an application that would demonstrate the use of gesture technology.  The following technology was used for this project:

* Leap Motion Controller is a gesture capture device that uses three infrared LEDs that generates pattern-less IR light and two monochromatic IR cameras that generate almost 200 frames per second of reflected data.  There are a number of official SDKs for different programming languages for the Leap motion.  The C# SDK is utilised for this project.

* Lego Mindstorms EV3 is a Lego robotic kit which can be used to build many types of robots which Lego blocks, motors, sensors and a programmable control brick.  The official way of programming the Mindstorms EV3 is using a GUI software using drag and drop blocks.  For this project I programmed the brick in C# using an unofficial API which is available [here](https://github.com/BrianPeek/legoev3).
